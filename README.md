A set of files for use with New Recruit to allow you to build armies for Halo Ground Command, Schism.
Largely uses the Schism datasheets as-is but I've integrated a few changes from the baseline Halo Ground Command community ruleset, and recommend using their Rule Errata document alongside these datasheets.
They've done a great job keeping Halo Ground Command supported.

The changes that I've integrated are as follows:
Most standard infantry units with 2/3 on their Damage track have gone up by one.
Heroic saves are now in the d6 format, and I've integrated some of the lowerings of Heroic Save capabilities. (Spartans go from a 2+ to a 3+, etc)
I've not included the Battle Squad / Lance rules as the Community ruleset has removed those due to balance issues.
Copied over the increased ranges of Frag and Plasma grenades, providing boosts to other 'grenade' type weapons like ODST demolition charges, which I buffed from 3" (Half the default grenade range) to 5" (Half new grenade range)
The Grav/Jump Pack special rule has been changed.
Added the new Lethal loadout (-1 to target Heroic Save) to a few weapons, following the example of the Community Ruleset.
Cloaking/ Stealth Field special rule changed.
